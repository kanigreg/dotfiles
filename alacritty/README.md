Since this part is configured on the host machine, some manual manipulation is required.

1. Installing a font with icon support (e.g. `DejaVuSansM Nerd Font Mono`) and add it in config file
2. Installing an alacritty theme (optional). I'm using [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/alacritty)
